This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS. The following is a visual representation of a VPC and its resources from the Preview pane shown when you create a VPC using the AWS Management Console. For an existing VPC, you can access this visualization on the Resource map tab. This example shows the resources that are initially selected on the Create VPC page when you choose to create the VPC plus other networking resources. This VPC is configured with an IPv4 CIDR and an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR, subnets in two Availability Zones, three route tables, an internet gateway, and a gateway endpoint. Because we've selected the internet gateway, the visualization indicates that traffic from the public subnets is routed to the internet because the corresponding route table sends the traffic to the internet gateway.","title":"How Amazon VPC works"},{"location":"How%20Amazon%20VPC%20works/#how-amazon-vpc-works","text":"With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined.
